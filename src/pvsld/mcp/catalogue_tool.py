"""The local-catalogue tool of the plugin (Stage 3.6.3): ``add_component_to_catalogue``.

When the user needs equipment the catalogue lacks, Claude reads its datasheet, shows the values,
and after the user confirms them calls the tool with the record. The datasheet travels by file
name only: the user's PDF is copied into ``<local catalogue>/hojas_tecnicas/`` first (tools never
take paths), and the tool hashes it for the record's provenance.
