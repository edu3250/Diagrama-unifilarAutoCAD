"""The MCP server of ADR-0001 (layer L1): workflow tools and resources over stdio.

Five tools: ``list_components`` and ``get_component`` read the component catalogue,
``size_pv_system`` sizes a design from it (Stage 3.5), ``validate_pv_design`` checks a spec and
``generate_single_line_diagram`` draws it. Four resources: the spec schema, the rule pack, the
symbol library and an example of the non-sizing sections a sizing request needs.

Claude fills and corrects a parameter spec; the deterministic core validates it and draws it. The
tool surface is deliberately small and has no primitive drawing tool and no code execution, so the
model never produces geometry (ADR-0001, point 4).

Rules the server keeps, because stdio and Windows make them easy to break:

* nothing but protocol frames goes to stdout: logs go to stderr (``main`` configures it) and the
  SDK moves file descriptor 1 aside while serving;
* the server writes only inside its output sandbox (``PVSLD_OUTPUT_DIR``, default ``./out``), and
  a call carries a drawing *name*, never a path;
* a spec that does not validate is a tool error that carries the findings, so Claude can fix it;
* the core is not re-entrant (it pins a process-global ezdxf option while a file is built), so
  generation is serialised with a lock.

This module intentionally does not use ``from __future__ import annotations``: the SDK builds the
tool schemas from the annotations of functions defined inside :func:`create_server`.

Designs Mexican photovoltaic systems and draws their single-line diagrams (CFE distributed \
generation, NOM-001-SEDE-2012) as DXF R2018.
Workflow:
1. Equipment comes from the component catalogue: list_components finds modules, inverters and DC \
breakers, get_component gives their datasheet values. Never invent equipment data or \
identifiers (Voc, Isc, ratings, RPU, cedula profesional): ask the user, or ask for the datasheet \
when a component is not in the catalogue.
2. To size a system, call size_pv_system with a module, inverters (or "auto"), a target and the \
non-sizing sections of the spec (example: resource {SIZING_TEMPLATE_URI}). It returns the \
selected design with a complete spec, ranked alternatives and why other configurations were \
rejected. Show the selection to the user before drawing.
3. Call validate_pv_design with the whole spec (the one size_pv_system returned, or one built \
from the schema {SCHEMA_URI}). Fix every error finding and validate again. The rules are in \
{RULEPACK_URI}, the drawing symbols in {SYMBOLS_URI}.
4. Call generate_single_line_diagram with the same spec, only when validation has no errors. It \
re-validates, writes the DXF into the server's output folder, verifies the file by reading it \
back and returns a PNG preview: look at it.
There are no tools to draw lines or run code; the server computes the geometry. Explain findings \
to the user in Spanish. Drawings are drafts: a responsible engineer must review and sign them \
before they are submitted.

(NOM-001-SEDE-2012, CFE distributed generation) without drawing anything. Read-only, takes \
milliseconds. Call it first, and again after every change to the spec.

Returns ok, findings and derived values. Each finding has rule_id, severity (error blocks \
drawing, warning does not), a Spanish message that says what is wrong and usually the limit to \
respect, the MX checklist ids and the NOM citations. GEN-001 means the input does not fit the \
schema (the subject is the path of the bad field). Derived values: kWp, kWac, string Voc at \

Draw the A3 single-line diagram of a validated PV spec as DXF R2018 and verify the written file \

this tool validates again and, if the spec has errors, writes nothing and returns a tool error \
that lists the findings (same format as validate_pv_design), so fix the spec and retry.

Files go to the server's output folder; you choose only a name, never a path. The same spec \
always gives byte-identical output. If a drawing with that name already exists with different \
content the call fails unless overwrite is true; identical content is reported as unchanged. \
Takes under a second, or 2 to 4 s with the preview.

Returns drawing_id, dxf_path, sha256, the read-back counts (audit, attribute round trip by \
COMP_ID, dangling ports) and, when preview is true, a PNG image of the sheet. Look at the image \
to check the layout. The drawing is a draft until the responsible engineer signs it."""

string OCPD, the inverter-output breaker and the copper conductors with voltage drop. Read-only, \
