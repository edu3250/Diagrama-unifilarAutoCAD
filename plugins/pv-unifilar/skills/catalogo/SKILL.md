description: Agrega al catálogo local de PvUnifilar un equipo que no está (módulo, inversor, fusible, interruptor, seccionador o cable) a partir de su hoja técnica en PDF, después de que el usuario confirma los valores. Úsala cuando falte un equipo en el catálogo o el usuario comparta la hoja técnica de un panel, inversor o protección.

# PvUnifilar: agregar un equipo al catálogo local

The bundled catalogue has the equipment the project owner reviewed. Anything else is added to the user's own local catalogue from its datasheet, and only after the user confirms the values. Never invent or guess a value. Talk to the user in Spanish.

Datasheet: $ARGUMENTS

## Steps

1. **Is it already there?** Call `list_components` (with the manufacturer) and check that the model is really missing. If it is there, say so and stop.
2. **Read the format and the folders.** Read the MCP resource `pvsld://catalogue/record-examples` of this plugin's `pvsld` server. It gives `datasheets_folder` (where the PDF goes), `how_to`, and one example record per `component_type`.
3. **Copy the PDF** the user gave into `datasheets_folder` (create the folder if needed), keeping its file name. Ask for the file if the user has not given one.
4. **Read the datasheet** and write one record in the format of the example of its `component_type`: one family, one variant per model or power rating, every value exactly as printed, with the unit in the field name. Use the manufacturer's model names for `component_id`, in UPPERCASE with `-` (for example `TRINA-TSM-450NEG9R.28`). In `source` give only `title`, `pages`, `extraction_method` and `notes`.
5. **Show the values to the user** in a table per variant (and the family values above it), and say from which page each block comes. Ask them to compare with the datasheet and confirm. Fix anything they correct.
6. **After they confirm**, call `add_component_to_catalogue` with the `record`, the PDF's file name as `datasheet`, and `user_confirmed: true`. If the tool lists problems (a missing or implausible value), fix them from the datasheet; ask the user only when the datasheet does not say.
7. **Tell the user** the new `component_id`s, that the equipment is now in their local catalogue for every design and in the project-sheet lists, and continue with the design that needed it.
